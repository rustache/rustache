Rustache [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rustache/rustache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rustache/rustache)
====

[Rustache](https://rustache.github.io) is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) implementation of the [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) spec.

## Documentation

The different Mustache tags are documented at the [mustache(5)](http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html) man page.

The project's docs page is located [here](https://rustache.github.io/doc/rustache/).

## Install

Install it through [Cargo](https://crates.io/):

```toml
[dependencies.rustache]
git = "https://github.com/rustache/rustache"
```

Then link it within your crate like so:

```rust
extern crate rustache;
```

## API Methods

The main forward interface that users will interact with when using Rustache are the `rustache::render_file` method and the `rustache::render_text` methods like so:

```rust
// Renders the given template file
rustache::render_file("path/to/template.html", &data)

// Renders the given template string
rustache::render_text("{{ name }}", &data)
```

Users also have the option to utilize more focused API methods for 
interfacing with Rustache. The following methods handle template 
files from a provided file path:

```rust
// Renders a template file from a HashBuilder to a specified writer
rustache::render_file_from_hb("path/to/template.html", &data, &writer)

// Renders a template file from a JSON enum to a specified writer
rustache::render_file_from_json_enum("path/to/template.html", &data, &writer)

// Renders a template file from a JSON string to a specified writer
rustache::render_file_from_json_string("path/to/template.html", &str, &writer)

// Renders a template file from a JSON file to a specified writer
rustache::render_file_from_json_file("path/to/template.html", "data/data.json", &writer)
```

The following methods handle templates in the form of text strings:

```rust
// Render template text from a specified HashBuilder to a specified writer
rustache::render_text_from_hb("{{ name }}", &data, &writer)

// Render template text from a JSON enum to a specified writer
rustache::render_text_from_json_enum("{{ name }}", &json, &writer)

// Render template text from a JSON string to a specified writer
rustache::render_text_from_json_string("{{ name }}", &str, &writer)

// Render template text from a JSON file to a specified writer
rustache::render_text_from_json_file("{{ name }}", "data/data.json", &writer)
```

## Examples

Here's an example of how to pass in data to a `render` method using the `HashBuilder`:

```rust
let mut writer = MemWriter::new();
let data = HashBuilder::new()
    .insert_string("name", "Bob");

rustache::render_text_from_hb("{{ name }}", &data, &mut writer);
```

Here's an example of how to pass in data in the form of a JSON `enum` to a `render` method:

```rust
let mut writer = MemWriter::new();
let data = json::from_str(r#"{"name": "Bob"}"#);

rustache::render_text_from_json_enum("{{ name }}", data, &mut writer);
```

## Testing

Simply clone and run:

```bash
cargo test
```
